# Animate!

'Animate!' can help people who want to learn animation
getting started with some basic animation knowledges.
Users can interactively learn anchor point and SwiftUI animations.
It also includes simple explanation videos for each basic animation principle,
helping people understand the principle.
The app can adjust its UI based on which device user is using, and View’s width.

TECH USED:

I mainly used SwiftUI building the app.
And also Google Translate for translating,
Apple Motion for making explanation videos.

NOTE:

Some content are translated from Chinese using Google Translation,
the ’12 animation principles’ or 'Twelve basic principles of animation'
were introduced by the Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas
in their 1981 book The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation,
this has become motion designers' consensus; the explanations are from Wikipedia.
